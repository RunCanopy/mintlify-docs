### Creating a Project

First, let's create a Project. Navigate the sidebar, click the Browse tab (it has a folder icon), and then click the circular plus button on the top right of the pane. Give it the name "Getting Started" and click the purple button.

You'll be taken the project page you just created. Next we need to create our Canopy.

### Creating Your Canopy
You should be on the project page for the "Getting Started" project. (If not, you can reach it via the Browse tab of the sidebar.) On the top right of the screen, you should see a button that says "New Canopy". Click it.
Fill out the name of "My First Canopy", and click the purple button. You'll be taken to the Canopy page you just created.

### Adding a Connector to Your Canopy

Click that "Add a Connector" button on the center of the page. That's shortcut to the sidebar's Connector tab, which you can also reach at any time by clicking the Hexagon with the plus sign on the far left of the screen.

Now let's select a Connector. For this example, we'll use the one we built in the "Building a Connector" guide. (If you don't have any connectors yet, complete that guide, and come back here afterward.)
Click the connector, and a sidebar pane will appear. The first tab of that pane says "Services". On it, you'll see at least one service. Click the purple button that says "+ Add" on the first one.

You should see a new service appear on the list. Let's try calling it!

### Calling Your Canopy

Click that blue button at the top right of your screen that says "Call". That will open the calling pane. But oh shoot, we have a problem.

We can now see that new connector isn't callable yet, because we don't have an endpoint attached to this Canopy yet. Let's do that first and come back.


### Creating an Endpoint

On the left sidebar, you should a see there is an chain/link icon. That's the Endpoints sidebar. Click it.
<img src="/images/canopy/endpoints.png" />
Click the circular plus icon on the top right of the pane. Give it the name "My First Endpoint", select "My First Canopy" from the dropdown, and click the purple "Add Endpoint" button.

Go ahead and close the Endpoints sidebar. Now let's try calling our Canopy again.



### Calling Your Canopy... Part 2

You should still be on the Canopy page. (If not, you can navigate back to it via the Browse sidebar tab.) Click that blue button at the top right of your screen that says "Call". That will open the calling pane. Now you can select "My First Endpoint" from the dropdown, and now you should see that new Canopy is callable!

Click the purple "Call Canopy" button, and you should see the response appear in the pane below. Congratulations, you've just called your first Canopy!

### Wrapping Up

That's the gist of Canopies. Now you can go back to the Canopy page, and click the "Add a Connector" button to add more connectors to your Canopy. You can also add more Endpoints to your Canopy, and even add more Canopies to your Project. Have fun!

### Definitions
#### Connector
A connector is a component that integrates APIs to be composable and transformable in a canopy.
#### Connector Argument
A connector argument is a variable specifying API request details for a connector.
#### Canopy
A canopy is a combined set of connectors that represents a final data output.
The connectors within a canopy are composed and transformed to produce output data.
A canopy can be connected to endpoints for clients to access its data.
#### Endpoint
An Endpoint (i.e. Canopy Endpoint) is a URL that clients send requests to and attain responses from a specific canopy.
Multiple endpoints can point to the same canopy, and a single canopy can be reconfigured to point to a different canopy.

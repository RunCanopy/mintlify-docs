    **Prerequisite** Keep in mind an api you want to make a request to and have documentation ready for that api.

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a
connector to access APIs. We will be using the
[OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) as an example.

## Step 1: Create a new connector
Navigate to the Connector Tab on the left sidebar and click on the **Plus (+)** button to open the connector builder.

</Frame>

Fill in name and description for your connector. You can also add a logo for your connector.

## Step 2: Add a new resource

We will add the `Current Weather Data` from OpenWeatherMap API as a resource. Click on the **Plus (+)** button on the right of services.

According to the OpenWeatherAPI the curl call is
```bash
    https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}
```

</Frame>
<Steps>
    <Step>
        Add a resource `name`*, description and `identifier`.
        Note: Name and identifier are required
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### URL

        Url: A destination URL: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={apiKey}`
        We will keep the `{lat}`, `{lon}`, and `{apiKey}` as a variable and will pass them at time of execution from the
        action.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Headers, Parameters, Body

        Parameters: Will be appended to the URL

        Headers: Will be added to the request headers

        Body: Will be added to the request body (only on POST, PUT, PATCH requests)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Arguments

        Arguments are the variables that will be passed to the resource at the time of execution.
        They can be at time of configuring (`Set`) or time of execution (`Required`).

        The Required arguments are to be `lat` and `lon` and they need to be sent at canopy call time.

        We will set apiKey as a `Set` argument as it will be same for all the calls.

        You can also Add Arguments as global arguments for the connector as a whole and not just the resource.
    </Step>
</Steps>

Repeat the steps to add more resources to the connector.

## Configure you connector

From the sources tab. Add the connector to your project.

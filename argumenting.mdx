Name the argument whatever name you pass in (examples to follow).

`url` field should look something like: 
`https://api.sampleapis.com/coffee/iced?page={page}`
Then in arguments, 
have a required argument with the `name` being `page`
Then when you call a canopy: 
`https://api.canopy.com/<>/call` 
body should have `{"page": 1}`
